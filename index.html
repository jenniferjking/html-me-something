                <h3> Magic Kingdom </h3>
                    <img src="file:///Users/jenniferjking/code/html-me-something/images/IMG_0935.jpg">

                    <p> It was my very first trip to Disney World, so, of course, we had to start in the Magic Kingdom. The whole experience was overwhelming. We checked out Cinderella's castle and a few of the shops before deciding what rides to conquer first. After heading over to Tomorrowland, we ended up going on Space Mountain. It was incredible! Follow that up with a maybe-not-worth-it three hour wait for The Seven Dwarve's Mine Train Ride. AFter a full day of heat, expensive food, and Disney themed rides, we finally came to the Haunted Mansion. It was what I was most excited about in this park. The outside was under construction, so I didn't get to see the actual "mansion" (more reason to go again), and the line was miserable. The ride itself? Amazing! Unfortunately, the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was also under construction, so I missed out on a Disney World classic. Overall the day was great, and a good representation on what was to come. I'm ready to take the trip again! </p>
                <h3> Disney&apos;s Animal Kingdom </h3>

                    <p>The Animal Kingdom was the first park that we hit on day two. There weren't too many attractions here, but it made up for it with how gorgeous it was! The whole thing was worth it just to see The Tree of Life. Our only ride was Expedition Everest. It was a crazy ride that left me with a slight case of motion sickness from the backwards drop, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. We followed that with a short walk through the mini zoo. We also got to take a sneak peak at the construction site of the new Avatar exhibit that they're building. I'd be excited to come back to this park in a few years to see how much it grows. </p> 
                <h3> Disney&apos;s Hollywood Studios </h3>

                        <figcaption> A view of the Hollywood Tower of Terror </figcaption>
                    <p> Next on the list? Hollywood Studios. My boyfriend was dying to ride Aerosmith's Rockin' Rollercoaster, so that was up first. Between the speed, the loops, and the neon lights, you hardly even know what hits you when the ride is over. You just know you had a really awesome time. We decided to take it easy and go on the Star Wars: The Aventure Continues. If you ever want to feel like absolute crap, ride this ride. Between being thrown back and forth and watching a 3D movie of zipping through space, you come out feeling sick. Because of this, I had to skip on the Hollywood Tower of Terror, Hollywood Studio's iconic ride. We did watch it go a few times, and finally moved on. </p>

                <h3> Epcot </h3>
                    <img src="file:///Users/jenniferjking/code/html-me-something/images/IMG_0987.jpg">
                        <figcaption> Spaceship Earth at Epcot. </figcaption>
                    <p> Epcot was a nice way to end the day. By this point, I was exhausted from non-stop rides, and my feet were covered in blisters. Epcot was more of an adult friendly park. Between the walk "around the world" and the number of shops. We spent a couple of hours taking it slow. Then we hit up Test Track. This may have been the coolest ride yet. After going through all the tests, our car came in first place! You only win bragging rights, but it was still 100% worth it! It was really cool to see Spaceship Earth lit up with the fireworks show going on in the background.</p>

                <h3> Universal Studios Florida </h3>
                    <img src="file:///Users/jenniferjking/code/html-me-something/images/IMG_0989.jpg">
                        <figcaption> Iconic globe at Universal Studios. </figcaption>
                    <p> After a couple days at Disney, Universal was a completely different experience. We started out on the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit. It was the first ride we rode, and the ride broke down at the end. We got stuck right before we got back to the station. It was the first time, I've ever had to be emergency evacuated from a rollercoaster. It was shut down for most of the day after that, so I'm glad we got a chance to ride it. I got to try a Duff beer from the Simpsons part of the park. We wandered around between The Terminator, Transformers, Men in Black, and the Mummy. The amount of things to do was overwhelming. 
                <h3> Universal&apos;s Island of Adventure </h3>
                    <img src="file:///Users/jenniferjking/code/html-me-something/images/IMG_1036.jpg">
                        <figcaption> Island of Adventure's lighthouse. </figcaption>
                    <p> It was must easier to move from park to park with Universal Studios, so it was more of a mash-up of what we did. The Hulk rollercoaster was the most intense ride of the trip. Doctor Doom's Fearfall was one of the most fun log flumes I've been on. I learned my lesson that I should save it for the last ride of the day from now on though. You get off the ride DRENCHED no matter where you're sitting. The Jurassic Park section was really neat too. I loved the forest feel with the random dinoaurs popping out from the bushes. 
                <h3> Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley </h3>

                        <figcaption> Gringrott's Bank in Diagon Alley </figcaption>
                    <p> This was by far my favorite point of the whole trip. I've been an avid Harry Potter fan from a young age, so geting a chance to step into that world was magical. We got to drink butterbeer, and pick out our wands. It was crazy to wonder around Diagon Alley. There were so many little alley ways with amazing shops. The animals were mechanical, so they were life like. We got to go inside of the Hogwarts castle, and take a trip through the hallway of portraits and Dumbledore's office. We also stepped on Platform 9 3/4 to ride the Hogwart's Express between the two parks. The whole experience was truly breathtaking. I would easily make the trip again for this part alone. </p>
